## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Holistic Analysis
```bash
cd examples/basic
node holistic-analysis.js
```

Individual Layer Usage

```bash
cd examples/basic  
node pointjs-usage.js
node hunchjs-usage.js
node intuitionjs-usage.js
```

🎯 Example Goals

Each example demonstrates:

· Practical Use Cases - Real scenarios you'll encounter
· Progressive Complexity - From simple to advanced usage
· Integration Patterns - How to combine with existing workflows
· Performance Considerations - Efficient usage at scale

🔧 Running Examples

Prerequisites

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Or install individual packages
npm install point.js hunch.js intuition.js insight.js
```

Execution

```bash
# Run specific example
node examples/basic/holistic-analysis.js

# Run all examples in a category
find examples/basic -name "*.js" -exec node {} \;
```

📖 Learning Path

We recommend this learning sequence:

1. Start with Basic Examples to understand individual layers
2. Progress to Advanced Examples for custom configurations
3. Explore Integration Examples for workflow integration
4. Apply Real-World Examples to your specific use cases
5. Teach with Educational Examples for team training
