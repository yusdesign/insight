# Insight Suite ðŸ§ 

A suite of intelligent development tools for understanding code at different cognitive levels.

## Packages

| Package | Version | Description |

## Philosophy

The Insight Suite follows a layered cognitive approach:

1. **Point** - Purpose & Direction (The "Why")
2. **Hunch** - Detection & Signals (The "What")  
3. **Intuition** - Pattern Recognition (The "How")
4. **Insight** - Understanding & Synthesis (The "So What")
